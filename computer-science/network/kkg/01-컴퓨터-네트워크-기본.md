## A Closer Look at Network Structure

- network edge

  - `applications`, `hosts`

- network core

  - `routers`, `network of networks`

- access networks, physical media

  - `communication links`

## Connection-Oriented Service

> Goal: data transfer between end systems

### TCP Service

- Reliable, In-order byte stream data transfer
- Flow Control - 흐름 제어
- Congestion Control - 혼잡 제어

## Protocol

> All communication in Internet `coordinated` by protocol

## Circuit Switching

> End-end resources reserved for "call"

## Packet Switching

> = Statical Multiplexing
> Sequence of A & B packet does not have fixed pattern, shared on demand

## Four Sources of Packet Delay

1. Nodal Processing

   - Check bit errors
   - Determine output link

2. Queueing

   - Time waiting at output link for transmission
   - Depends on congestion level of router

3. Transmission Delay

   - R = link bandwidth (bps)
   - L = packet length (bits)
   - Time to send bits into link = L/R

4. Propagation Delay

   - d = length of physical link
   - s = propagation speed in medium (~2 \* 10 <sup>8</sup> m/sec)
   - Propagation Delay = d/s
